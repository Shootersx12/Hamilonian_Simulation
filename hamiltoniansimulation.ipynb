We will decompose $\\mathbf{A}$ using [Cholesky decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesky_decomposition) to get a square matrix where its product with its conjugate transpose is equal to $\\mathbf{A}$. This matrix is the same size as $\\mathbf{A}$, however, so we must pad it with 4 columns of zeroes to get our matrix $\\mathbf{B}$ of size $N \\times (N+4)$ so $\\mathbf{H}$ has a size corresponding to a power of two. We can then create the block Hamiltonian with the proper size using $\\mathbf{B}$ and $\\mathbf{B}^†$, and generate its full Pauli list using Qiskit's `SparsePauliOp.from_operator` [[3](#SparsePauliOp)] function.\n",

This is to ensure that the circuit depth is at a reasonable range (low thousands) given the limits of current quantum hardware.

        "The cropping algorithm, defined in the `crop_pauli_list` function, first selects 120 terms (60%) by going through each character position from the end to the start and picking the Pauli terms with the largest coefficients that contain each of the four possibilities ($I$, $X$, $Y$, $Z$) at that character position. If all positions are exhausted before reaching 120 terms, the algorithm takes another pass through the character positions until 120 are selected. The other 80 terms (40%) are selected by picking the 80 remaining terms with the largest coefficients. The algorithm balances important high-coefficient terms with diversity in the 200 selected terms.\n",
